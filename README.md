# cpp-programs

The cpp-programs repository is a compilation of all the c++ programs
that I wrote in CS124 (procedural programming), CS165 (Object-Oriented Programming)
and CS235 (Data Structures) as well as for personal projects (programs not required 
for class). Each of these programs are stored in the respective directory.

Please note that in CS165 and CS235 some of the code was written by professors. 
The programs that were written by professors will have "Author: Brother __________"
at the top of the program. Otherwise, Author: Chase Busacker
should be at the top in the header comment.
